# *Tableau Folder Icons*

## *Description*


This folder is used to house the Tableau folder images on both the Production & Test server. 
The server references the link associated with this GIT repo thus it cannot be private or the connection will be blocked.
This folder should never store any potential PHI as this repository is not private.

## *Instructions*

The icon should be first a .SVG file, a vector graphic that can be resized to any dimension. The image should then be resized by opening the file in visual code studio to edit the width & height dimensions. 
The width should be 250 & height of 150. Then convert it to a PNG file to take advantage of its transparency. N
