# *Tableau Folder Icons*

## *description*


This folder is used to house the Tableau folder images on both the Production & Test server. 
The server references the link associated with this GIT repo thus it cannot be private or the connection will be blocked.
This folder should never store any potential PHI as this repository is not private.
